Hi! My name is Clement Fung and I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. Hoping to write about my life and thoughts about CS research.
My personal page [can be found here](https://clementfung.me).
This page uses the [Purelog](https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog) Jekyll theme.
